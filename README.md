# AudioML Pipeline

Basic proof of concept for an audio processing pipeline for a denoising machine learning model.

- [ ] Makefile for project setup and environment preparation (virtual environment setup, installing Python libraries, downloading files)
- [ ] Data Preprocessing: process audio as Python-readable data, normalise.
- [ ] Feed to machine learning model.
- [ ] Bash script to run pipeline and output denoised audio.
